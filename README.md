# Installation guide

Run the following command to install Rebecca with SQLite database:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/rebeccapanel/Rebecca-scripts/raw/master/rebecca.sh)" @ install
```

Run the following command to install Rebecca with MySQL database:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/rebeccapanel/Rebecca-scripts/raw/master/rebecca.sh)" @ install --database mysql
```

Run the following command to install Rebecca with MariaDB database:
```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/rebeccapanel/Rebecca-scripts/raw/master/rebecca.sh)" @ install --database mariadb
```

Once the installation is complete:

- You will see the logs that you can stop watching them by closing the terminal or pressing `Ctrl+C`
- The Rebecca files will be located at `/opt/rebecca`
- The configuration file can be found at `/opt/rebecca/.env` (refer to [configurations](#configuration) section to see variables)
- The data files will be placed at `/var/lib/rebecca`
- For security reasons, the Rebecca dashboard is not accessible via IP address. Therefore, you must obtain an SSL certificate and access your Rebecca dashboard by opening a web browser and navigating to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN:8000/dashboard/` (replace YOUR_DOMAIN with your actual domain)
- You can also use SSH port forwarding to access the Rebecca dashboard locally without a domain. Replace `user@serverip` with your actual SSH username and server IP and Run the command below:

```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@serverip
```

Finally, you can enter the following link in your browser to access your Rebecca dashboard:

http://localhost:8000/dashboard/

You will lose access to the dashboard as soon as you close the SSH terminal. Therefore, this method is recommended only for testing purposes.

Next, you need to create a sudo admin for logging into the Rebecca dashboard by the following command

```bash
rebecca cli admin create --role full_access
```

That's it! You can login to your dashboard using these credentials

> **Full access admins** can only be created by another full access admin from the dashboard or by using the on-box `rebecca cli`.  
> If you ever need to promote an existing sudo admin, run  
> `rebecca cli admin change-role --username YOUR_ADMIN --role full_access`

To see the help message of the Rebecca script, run the following command

```bash
rebecca --help
```

If you are eager to run the project using the source code, check the section below
<details markdown="1">
<summary><h3>Manual install (advanced)</h3></summary>

Install xray on your machine

You can install it using [Xray-install](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install)

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh)" @ install
```

Clone this project and install the dependencies (you need Python >= 3.8)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rebeccapanel/Rebecca.git
cd Rebecca
wget -qO- https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3 -
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, to have an isolated environment you can use [Python Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)

Then run the following command to run the database migration scripts

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

If you want to use the CLI, you can link the bundled `rebecca-cli.py` to a new executable name and install the auto-completion:

```bash
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/rebecca-cli.py /usr/bin/rebecca-cli
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rebecca-cli
rebecca-cli completion install
```

Now it's time to configuration

Make a copy of `.env.example` file, take a look and edit it using a text editor like `nano`.

You probably like to modify the admin credentials.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

> Check [configurations](#configuration) section for more information

Eventually, launch the application using command below

```bash
python3 main.py
```

To launch with linux systemctl (copy rebecca.service file to `/var/lib/rebecca/rebecca.service`)

```
systemctl enable /var/lib/rebecca/rebecca.service
systemctl start rebecca
```

To use with nginx

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  example.com;

    ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    location ~* /(dashboard|statics|sub|api|docs|redoc|openapi.json) {
        proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

  # xray-core ws-path: /
  # client ws-path: /rebecca/me/2087
    #
  # All traffic is proxied through port 443, and sent to the xray port (2087, 2088, etc.).
  # The '/rebecca' in the location regex path can be changed to any value you like.
    #
  # /${path}/${username}/${xray-port}
  location ~* /rebecca/.+/(.+)$ {
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:$1/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

or

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
  server_name  rebecca.example.com;

    ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

By default the app will be run on `http://localhost:8000/dashboard`. You can configure it by changing the `UVICORN_HOST` and `UVICORN_PORT` environment variables.

# Documentation

Rebecca documentation is a work in progress. We welcome and appreciate your contributions to help us improve it. Please open issues or PRs in the main repository.


# API

Rebecca provides a REST API that enables developers to interact with its services programmatically. To view the API documentation in Swagger UI or ReDoc, set the configuration variable `DOCS=True` and navigate to `/docs` and `/redoc`.


# Backup

It's always a good idea to back up your Rebecca files regularly to prevent data loss in case of system failures or accidental deletion. Here are the steps to back up Rebecca:

1. By default, all Rebecca important files are saved in `/var/lib/rebecca` (Docker versions). Copy the entire `/var/lib/rebecca` directory to a backup location of your choice, such as an external hard drive or cloud storage.
2. Additionally, make sure to back up your env file, which contains your configuration variables, and also your Xray config file. If you installed Rebecca using rebecca-scripts (recommended installation approach), the env and other configurations should be inside the `/opt/rebecca/` directory.

Rebecca's backup service efficiently zips all necessary files and sends them to your specified Telegram bot. It supports SQLite, MySQL, and MariaDB databases. One of its key features is automation, allowing you to schedule backups every hour. There are no limitations concerning Telegram's upload limits for bots; if a file exceeds the limit, it will be split and sent in multiple parts. Additionally, you can initiate an immediate backup at any time.

Install the Latest Version of Rebecca Command:
```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/rebeccapanel/Rebecca-scripts/raw/master/rebecca.sh)" @ install-script
```

Setup the Backup Service:
```bash
rebecca backup-service
```

Get an Immediate Backup:
```bash
rebecca backup
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that you have a backup of all your Rebecca files and data, as well as your configuration variables and Xray configuration, in case you need to restore them in the future. Remember to update your backups regularly to keep them up-to-date.

# Telegram Bot

Rebecca comes with an integrated Telegram bot that can handle server management, user creation and removal, and send notifications. This bot can be easily enabled by following a few simple steps, and it provides a convenient way to interact with Rebecca without having to log in to the server every time.

To enable Telegram Bot:

1. set `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` to your bot's API Token
2. set `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ID` to your Telegram account's numeric ID, you can get your ID from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)

# Rebecca CLI

Rebecca comes with an integrated CLI which allows administrators to have direct interaction with it.

If you've installed Rebecca using the easy install script, you can access the CLI commands by running

```bash
rebecca cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

For more information, you can read the CLI documentation in `./cli/README.md`.

# Rebecca Node

The Rebecca project introduces the [Rebecca-node](https://github.com/rebeccapanel/Rebecca-node), which enables infrastructure distribution. With Rebecca-node, you can distribute your infrastructure across multiple locations, unlocking benefits such as redundancy, high availability, scalability, and flexibility. Rebecca-node empowers users to connect to different servers, offering them the flexibility to choose and connect to multiple servers instead of being limited to only one server.
For more detailed information and installation instructions, please refer to the [Rebecca-node repository](https://github.com/rebeccapanel/Rebecca-node).

# Webhook notifications

You can set a webhook address and Rebecca will send the notifications to that address.

the requests will be sent as a post request to the adress provided by `WEBHOOK_ADDRESS` with `WEBHOOK_SECRET` as `x-webhook-secret` in the headers.

Example request sent from Rebecca:

```
Headers:
Host: 0.0.0.0:9000
User-Agent: python-requests/2.28.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
x-webhook-secret: something-very-very-secret
Content-Length: 107
Content-Type: application/json



Body:
{"username": "rebecca_test_user", "action": "user_updated", "enqueued_at": 1680506457.636369, "tries": 0}
```

Different action typs are: `user_created`, `user_updated`, `user_deleted`, `user_limited`, `user_expired`, `user_disabled`, `user_enabled`
